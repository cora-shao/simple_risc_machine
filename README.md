Lab 7 bonus ONLY: Do NOT use this repository for Lab 7 or your TA will not get
your code during your marking session.

See the Lab 7 Bonus handout for detailed instructions for what you need to do
for the bonus.

IMPORTANT:  Ensure your submission includes a Quartus project file and a
Modelsim Project File and that both specify all (System)Verilog files required
